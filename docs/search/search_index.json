Preamble The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public. The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version. An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions \u201cThis License\u201d refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License. \u201cCopyright\u201d also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \u201cThe Program\u201d refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \u201cyou\u201d. \u201cLicensees\u201d and \u201crecipients\u201d may be individuals or organizations. To \u201cmodify\u201d a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \u201cmodified version\u201d of the earlier work or a work \u201cbased on\u201d the earlier work. A \u201ccovered work\u201d means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \u201cpropagate\u201d a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \u201cconvey\u201d a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \u201cAppropriate Legal Notices\u201d to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code The \u201csource code\u201d for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \u201cObject code\u201d means any non-source form of a work. A \u201cStandard Interface\u201d means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The \u201cSystem Libraries\u201d of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \u201cMajor Component\u201d, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The \u201cCorresponding Source\u201d for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \u201ckeep intact all notices\u201d. c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \u201caggregate\u201d if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A \u201cUser Product\u201d is either (1) a \u201cconsumer product\u201d, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \u201cnormally used\u201d refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. \u201cInstallation Information\u201d for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms \u201cAdditional permissions\u201d are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \u201cfurther restrictions\u201d within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An \u201centity transaction\u201d is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents A \u201ccontributor\u201d is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \u201ccontributor version\u201d. A contributor's \u201cessential patent claims\u201d are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \u201ccontrol\u201d includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a \u201cpatent license\u201d is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \u201cgrant\u201d such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \u201cKnowingly relying\u201d means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License. 14. Revised Versions of this License The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License \u201cor any later version\u201d applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \u201cAS IS\u201d WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16 If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \u201ccopyright\u201d line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Affero General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a \u201cSource\u201d link that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \u201ccopyright disclaimer\u201d for the program, if necessary.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public. The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version. An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.","title":"Preamble"},{"location":"LICENSE.html#terms-and-conditions","text":"","title":"TERMS AND CONDITIONS"},{"location":"LICENSE.html#0-definitions","text":"\u201cThis License\u201d refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License. \u201cCopyright\u201d also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \u201cThe Program\u201d refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \u201cyou\u201d. \u201cLicensees\u201d and \u201crecipients\u201d may be individuals or organizations. To \u201cmodify\u201d a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \u201cmodified version\u201d of the earlier work or a work \u201cbased on\u201d the earlier work. A \u201ccovered work\u201d means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \u201cpropagate\u201d a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \u201cconvey\u201d a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.

An interactive user interface displays \u201cAppropriate Legal Notices\u201d to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.

A \u201cMajor Component\u201d, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The \u201cCorresponding Source\u201d for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.

This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

We'll build a simple function that lists the audio files required by a LibreLingo course. (Whether they exist or not yet) LibreLingo comes with some tools that make it easier to build such programs and also to test them. I structured the tutorial as a small Test-Driven-Development session so that you'll see how to use these tools. By the end of the tutorial you should have a good basis to build your own apps, APIs or software using LibreLingo, or to contribute to LibreLingo or existing LibreLingo-based software. Requirements To enjoy this tutorial, you'll need to have some experience with Python, and you also need to have Python 3.9 installed on your system, as well as the poetry dependency management tool . Setting up your project To set up our project, we're going to first create an empty folder. If you are creating your app inside the LibreLingo monorepo, that's how you'd do it: cd apps/ mkdir librelingo_audios cd librelingo_audios/ Let's initialize our project using poetry : poetry init If you want to learn more about poetry , you can check out their documentation on initializing your project . Let's create the basic folder structure of our project: mkdir librelingo_audios mkdir tests touch librelingo_audios/__init__.py We want to test our app, so we need to install pytest as a development dependency of our project: poetry add --dev pytest Let's see if pytest works: poetry run pytest The output is: ==================================== test session starts ===================================== platform linux -- Python 3.9.1, pytest-6.2.2, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1 rootdir: /home/kdani/repos/LibreLingo/apps/librelingo_audios collected 0 items =================================== no tests ran in 0.00s ==================================== Looks like pytest works and we can start writing our tests!

[100%] ===================================== 1 passed in 0.01s ====================================== Loading LibreLingo courses LibreLingo comes with a Python package that facilitates loading courses in Python programs. Let's install it: poetry add librelingo_yaml_loader Let's play around with this library in ipython to see how it works: poetry run ipython In [1]: import librelingo_yaml_loader In [2]: course = librelingo_yaml_loader.load_course('../../courses/spanish-from-english/') We've loaded our course into the variable course . Now you should be able to access course data. For example, we can see what the target language of the course is: In [3]: course.target_language.name Out[3]: 'Spanish' We can see what the title of the first Module is: In [4]: course.modules[0].title Out[4]: 'Basics' We can list the Phrase objects included in the second Skill of the first Module like so: In [6]: course.modules[0].skills[1].phrases Out[6]: [Phrase(in_target_language=['Buen provecho'], in_source_language=['Enjoy your meal']), Phrase(in_target_language=['Por favor'], in_source_language=['Please']), Phrase(in_target_language=['Pan, por favor'], in_source_language=['Bread, please']), Phrase(in_target_language=['Agua, por favor'], in_source_language=['Water, please']), Phrase(in_target_language=['Cecilia bebe agua'], in_source_language=['Cecilia drinks water']), Phrase(in_target_language=['La pareja bebe cerveza'], in_source_language=['The couple drinks beer']), Phrase(in_target_language=['Jos\u00e9 come pan'], in_source_language=['Jos\u00e9 eats bread']), Phrase(in_target_language=['Yo como pasta'], in_source_language=['I eat pasta'])] Adding some tests We'll need some data to write our tests. We could use real data here, but hat would have some disadvantages: Real courses evolve over time, so they might break our tests in the future A real course can be difficult to navigate due to it's size A real course can take up a lot of memory Loading real courses could slow our tests down Thankfully, LibreLingo comes with a library that has fake data to simplify writing tests! Let's install it: poetry add --dev librelingo-fakes Let's remove our existing test: def test_returns_hello_world(): assert list_missing_audios() == \"Hello World\" And replace it with a real test that verifies that an empty course doesn't need any audio files: from librelingo_fakes import fakes from librelingo_audios.list_missing_audios import list_missing_audios def test_an_empty_course_does_not_have_any_audios(): assert list(list_missing_audios(fakes.courseEmpty)) == [] If we run our tests again, we see the following failure: ==================================== test session starts ===================================== platform linux -- Python 3.9.1, pytest-6.2.2, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1 rootdir: /home/kdani/repos/LibreLingo/apps/librelingo_audios plugins: pyfakefs-4.4.0, snapshottest-0.6.0 collected 1 item tests/test_list_missing_audios.py F [100%] ========================================== FAILURES ========================================== _______________________ test_an_empty_course_does_not_have_any_audios ________________________ def test_an_empty_course_does_not_have_any_audios(): > assert list(list_missing_audios(fakes.courseEmpty)) == [] E TypeError: list_missing_audios() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given tests/test_list_missing_audios.py:7: TypeError ================================== short test summary info =================================== FAILED tests/test_list_missing_audios.py::test_an_empty_course_does_not_have_any_audios - T... ===================================== 1 failed in 0.03s ====================================== Let's cheat a little bit to make that test pass: def list_missing_audios(course): return [] This shows us that our \"implementation\" already works for empty courses, but that's a rather unrealistic edge-case. So we need to come up with some more precise test cases to force ourselves to write the correct implementation. Let's look at the first fake course. By running this code, we figure out that this course has 2 phrases in total: In [41]: count = 0 In [42]: for module in fakes.course1.modules: ...: for skill in module.skills: ...: count += len(skill.phrases) ...: In [43]: count Out[43]: 2 Every phrase has one corresponding audio, so this means our fake course is going to need 2 audios. We expect our function to return 2 items: def test_a_course_with_2_phrases_needs_2_audios(): assert len(list(list_missing_audios(fakes.course1))) == 2 Let's cheat again to make that test pass: def list_missing_audios(course): if not course.modules: return [] return [\"foo\", 42] By further exploration, we learn that the second fake course doesn't have any phrases: In [41]: count = 0 In [42]: for module in fakes.course2.modules: ...: for skill in module.skills: ...: count += len(skill.phrases) ...: In [43]: count Out[43]: 0 Lets change the test for the empty course to instead use course2: def test_a_course_with_0_phrases_needs_zero_audios(): assert len(list(list_missing_audios(fakes.course2))) == 0 Our tests are failing again: ==================================== test session starts ===================================== platform linux -- Python 3.9.1, pytest-6.2.2, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1 rootdir: /home/kdani/repos/LibreLingo/apps/librelingo_audios plugins: pyfakefs-4.4.0, snapshottest-0.6.0 collected 2 items tests/test_list_missing_audios.py F.

One problem is that although now every phrase is there, the output format is still useless. We need to include the text of each phrase in the target language of the course.

If they want to create those files, then for practical reasons the filenames should follow a standardized system that other LibreLingo-related software can also recognize. To achieve that, we can use the audio_id function from librelingo-utils . Let's start simple.

We better make sure somehow that audio_id is actually used to perform the filename-logic. First let's install librelingo-utils : poetry add librelingo-utils And write a tests that only passes if our function calls audio_id . To do that, we'll need to install pytest-mock : poetry add --dev pytest-mock We can now write our test: def test_calls_audio_id_to_get_the_id(mocker): audio_id = mocker.patch('librelingo_audios.list_missing_audios.audio_id') list_missing_audios(fakes.course1) assert audio_id.call_count == 2 This will mock the audio_id function and see how many times it has been called. We assert that it has to run twice, since there are 2 phrases that need audio files. ==================================== test session starts ===================================== platform linux -- Python 3.9.1, pytest-6.2.2, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1 rootdir: /home/kdani/repos/LibreLingo/apps/librelingo_audios plugins: pyfakefs-4.4.0, mock-3.5.1, snapshottest-0.6.0 collected 6 items tests/test_list_missing_audios.py .....F [100%] ========================================== FAILURES ========================================== _____________________________ test_calls_audio_id_to_get_the_id ______________________________ mocker = <pytest_mock.plugin.MockerFixture object at 0x7ff94ee398e0> def test_calls_audio_id_to_get_the_id(mocker): > audio_id = mocker.patch('librelingo_audios.list_missing_audios.audio_id') tests/test_list_missing_audios.py:29: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ /home/kdani/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/librelingo-audios-yD2wurwN-py3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pytest_mock/plugin.py:352: in __call__ return self._start_patch( /home/kdani/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/librelingo-audios-yD2wurwN-py3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pytest_mock/plugin.py:161: in _start_patch mocked = p.start() # type: unittest.mock.MagicMock /usr/lib/python3.9/unittest/mock.py:1541: in start result = self.__enter__() /usr/lib/python3.9/unittest/mock.py:1405: in __enter__ original, local = self.get_original() _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ self = <unittest.mock._patch object at 0x7ff94ee39a00> def get_original(self): target = self.getter() name = self.attribute original = DEFAULT local = False try: original = target.__dict__[name] except (AttributeError, KeyError): original = getattr(target, name, DEFAULT) else: local = True if name in _builtins and isinstance(target, ModuleType): self.create = True if not self.create and original is DEFAULT: > raise AttributeError( \"%s does not have the attribute %r\" % (target, name) ) E AttributeError: <function list_missing_audios at 0x7ff94ee4c5e0> does not have the attribute 'audio_id' /usr/lib/python3.9/unittest/mock.py:1378: AttributeError ================================== short test summary info =================================== FAILED tests/test_list_missing_audios.py::test_calls_audio_id_to_get_the_id - AttributeErro... ================================ 1 failed, 5 passed in 0.13s ================================= That's not exactly what I expected.

The only one way our implementation can cheat is if the return value is one simple static example, which is exactly what we have right now.

Let's make sure it's always the second item in the output: def test_result_includes_the_phrase_in_the_target_language(): result = list(list_missing_audios(fakes.course1)) # We are using in_target_language[0] because only the first version is used for audios assert result[0][1] == fakes.course1.modules[0].skills[0].phrases[0].in_target_language[0] Let's run our tests again: ==================================== test session starts ===================================== platform linux -- Python 3.9.1, pytest-6.2.2, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1 rootdir: /home/kdani/repos/LibreLingo/apps/librelingo_audios plugins: pyfakefs-4.4.0, snapshottest-0.6.0 collected 3 items tests/test_list_missing_audios.py ..F [100%] ========================================== FAILURES ========================================== ___________________ test_result_includes_the_phrase_in_the_target_language ___________________ def test_result_includes_the_phrase_in_the_target_language(): result = list(list_missing_audios(fakes.course1)) > assert result[0][1] == fakes.course1.modules[0].skills[0].phrases[0].in_target_language E TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable tests/test_list_missing_audios.py:16: TypeError ================================== short test summary info =================================== FAILED tests/test_list_missing_audios.py::test_result_includes_the_phrase_in_the_target_language ================================ 1 failed, 2 passed in 0.03s ================================= Let's try cheating with the implementation: def list_missing_audios(course): for module in course.modules: for skill in module.skills: for phrase in skill.phrases: yield [None, \"\"] Now we get this error: ==================================== test session starts ===================================== platform linux -- Python 3.9.1, pytest-6.2.2, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1 rootdir: /home/kdani/repos/LibreLingo/apps/librelingo_audios plugins: pyfakefs-4.4.0, snapshottest-0.6.0 collected 3 items tests/test_list_missing_audios.py ..F [100%] ========================================== FAILURES ========================================== ___________________ test_result_includes_the_phrase_in_the_target_language ___________________ def test_result_includes_the_phrase_in_the_target_language(): result = list(list_missing_audios(fakes.course1)) > assert result[0][1] == fakes.course1.modules[0].skills[0].phrases[0].in_target_language E AssertionError: assert '' == ['lorem ipsum'] E + where ['lorem ipsum'] = Phrase(in_target_language=['lorem ipsum'], in_source_language=['john smith']).in_target_language tests/test_list_missing_audios.py:16: AssertionError ================================== short test summary info =================================== FAILED tests/test_list_missing_audios.py::test_result_includes_the_phrase_in_the_target_language ================================ 1 failed, 2 passed in 0.03s ================================= We can continue cheating though: def list_missing_audios(course): for module in course.modules: for skill in module.skills: for phrase in skill.phrases: yield [None, \"lorem ipsum\"] Our tests are now passing again \ud83c\udf89!

If they want to create those files, then for practical reasons the filenames should follow a standardized system that other LibreLingo-related software can also recognize. To achieve that, we can use the audio_id function from librelingo-utils . Let's start simple. First let's make sure that the IDs are string: def test_audio_id_is_a_string(): assert [type(result[0]) for result in list_missing_audios(fakes.course1)] == [str, str] ==================================== test session starts ===================================== platform linux -- Python 3.9.1, pytest-6.2.2, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1 rootdir: /home/kdani/repos/LibreLingo/apps/librelingo_audios plugins: pyfakefs-4.4.0, snapshottest-0.6.0 collected 5 items tests/test_list_missing_audios.py ....F [100%] ========================================== FAILURES ========================================== _________________________________ test_audio_id_is_a_string __________________________________ def test_audio_id_is_a_string(): > assert [type(result[0]) for result in list_missing_audios(fakes.course1)] == [str, str] E AssertionError: assert [<class 'None...s 'NoneType'>] == [<class 'str'>, <class 'str'>] E At index 0 diff: <class 'NoneType'> != <class 'str'> E Use -v to get the full diff tests/test_list_missing_audios.py:24: AssertionError ================================== short test summary info =================================== FAILED tests/test_list_missing_audios.py::test_audio_id_is_a_string - AssertionError: asser... ================================ 1 failed, 4 passed in 0.04s ================================= We can still cheat by returning an empty string: def list_missing_audios(course): for module in course.modules: for skill in module.skills: for phrase in skill.phrases: # Returning only the first version because # the other versions never need audio. text = phrase.in_target_language[0] yield [\"\", text] And out tests are passing again... We better make sure somehow that audio_id is actually used to perform the filename-logic. First let's install librelingo-utils : poetry add librelingo-utils And write a tests that only passes if our function calls audio_id . To do that, we'll need to install pytest-mock : poetry add --dev pytest-mock We can now write our test: def test_calls_audio_id_to_get_the_id(mocker): audio_id = mocker.patch('librelingo_audios.list_missing_audios.audio_id') list_missing_audios(fakes.course1) assert audio_id.call_count == 2 This will mock the audio_id function and see how many times it has been called.

Looks like mocking is problematic in Python when your file name is the same of a function name, because it will try to mock an attribute of the function instead of the file. After some Googling I couldn't find an easy and clean solution for this, so let's just rename list_missing_audios.py to functions.py to avoid trouble. I'm planning to put more functions here anyway. In our test file, let's change the import: from librelingo_audios.functions import list_missing_audios Let's change the mock: def test_calls_audio_id_to_get_the_id(mocker): audio_id = mocker.patch('librelingo_audios.functions.audio_id') list_missing_audios(fakes.course1) assert audio_id.call_count == 2 Let's also change the import in __init__.py : __version__ = '0.1.0' from librelingo_audios.functions import list_missing_audios Now if we run our tests, we see the failure that I originally expected, or at least something similar: ==================================== test session starts ===================================== platform linux -- Python 3.9.1, pytest-6.2.2, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1 rootdir: /home/kdani/repos/LibreLingo/apps/librelingo_audios plugins: pyfakefs-4.4.0, mock-3.5.1, snapshottest-0.6.0 collected 6 items tests/test_list_missing_audios.py .....F [100%] ========================================== FAILURES ========================================== _____________________________ test_calls_audio_id_to_get_the_id ______________________________ mocker = <pytest_mock.plugin.MockerFixture object at 0x7f458c9cc8e0> def test_calls_audio_id_to_get_the_id(mocker): audio_id = mocker.patch('librelingo_audios.functions.audio_id') list_missing_audios(fakes.course1) > assert audio_id.call_count == 2 E AssertionError: assert 0 == 2 E + where 0 = <MagicMock name='audio_id' id='139936688556448'>.call_count tests/test_list_missing_audios.py:31: AssertionError ================================== short test summary info =================================== FAILED tests/test_list_missing_audios.py::test_calls_audio_id_to_get_the_id - AssertionErro... ================================ 1 failed, 5 passed in 0.04s ================================= Whoops, our test forgot to actually iterate over the result, lets wrap the function call in list() to fix that. def test_calls_audio_id_to_get_the_id(mocker): audio_id = mocker.patch('librelingo_audios.functions.audio_id') list(list_missing_audios(fakes.course1)) assert audio_id.call_count == 2 Now let's change the implementation so that it actually calls audio_id : def list_missing_audios(course): for module in course.modules: for skill in module.skills: for phrase in skill.phrases: # Returning only the first version because # the other versions never need audio. text = phrase.in_target_language[0] audio_id(course.source_language, \"lorem ipsum\") yield [\"\", text] Our tests are now passing: ==================================== test session starts ===================================== platform linux -- Python 3.9.1, pytest-6.2.2, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1 rootdir: /home/kdani/repos/LibreLingo/apps/librelingo_audios plugins: pyfakefs-4.4.0, mock-3.5.1, snapshottest-0.6.0 collected 6 items tests/test_list_missing_audios.py ......

Let's make another test case to make it impossible to cheat. Since the return value of the mock function is entirely determined by the fake value that we supply in our test case, this is a value the implementation can only reproduce by actually calling the function and taking the return value. The only one way our implementation can cheat is if the return value is one simple static example, which is exactly what we have right now. The most straightforward way to avoid that is by adding an identical test case with a different mock value: def test_returns_correct_audio_id_2(mocker): audio_id = mocker.patch('librelingo_audios.functions.audio_id') audio_id.return_value = \"foobar\" assert list(list_missing_audios(fakes.course1))[0][0] == \"foobar\" ==================================== test session starts ===================================== platform linux -- Python 3.9.1, pytest-6.2.2, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1 rootdir: /home/kdani/repos/LibreLingo/apps/librelingo_audios plugins: pyfakefs-4.4.0, mock-3.5.1, snapshottest-0.6.0 collected 9 items tests/test_list_missing_audios.py ........F [100%] ========================================== FAILURES ========================================== ______________________________ test_returns_correct_audio_id_2 _______________________________ mocker = <pytest_mock.plugin.MockerFixture object at 0x7f83d4646a00> def test_returns_correct_audio_id_2(mocker): audio_id = mocker.patch('librelingo_audios.functions.audio_id') audio_id.return_value = \"foobar\" > assert list(list_missing_audios(fakes.course1))[0][0] == \"foobar\" E AssertionError: assert 'omg' == 'foobar' E - foobar E + omg tests/test_list_missing_audios.py:51: AssertionError ================================== short test summary info =================================== FAILED tests/test_list_missing_audios.py::test_returns_correct_audio_id_2 - AssertionError:... ================================ 1 failed, 8 passed in 0.05s ================================= Let's fix our implementation: from librelingo_utils import audio_id def list_missing_audios(course): for module in course.modules: for skill in module.skills: for phrase in skill.phrases: # Returning only the first version because # the other versions never need audio. text = phrase.in_target_language[0] id_ = audio_id(course.target_language, phrase.in_target_language[0]) yield [id_, text] Now let's do a little bit of refactoring.

Understanding this document is the first step if you want to: - edit or improve an existing course - contribute a new accepted answer - create a new course from scratch This is also a good resource if you just want to learn about the course system in general. Confused? Ask people on GitHub Discussions. Table of Contents: - Getting started - Basics - Terminology - Exploring the courses - Things to do for new contributors - Courses currently open for contributions - For English speakers - Caution - Languages that don't use the Latin alphabet Getting started Totally new to LibreLingo? Head to the Basics section! It will give you a general understanding of the course system. Want to edit or improve existing courses? Check out this page about editing courses . If you want to create new courses (typically suited for course designers or advanced users), go to this page . Basics Terminology You'll need to have an idea on basic terminology used in LibreLingo: A Course is a set of Modules. There is typically one course for each language pair. e.g. Spanish for English speakers, Japanese for Italian speakers, etc. A Module is a set of Skills. A Skill is a small unit of course material. In the web app, the user will typically practice a Skill at a time. These concepts represent a hierarchical structure to LibreLingo course material: Courses > Modules > Skills The target language is the language the course is meant to teach. The source langauge is a language that users of the course are assumed to know. Exploring the courses To have a better understanding of how courses work, you can explore how the course files are organized on this repository. You will find courses in the courses directory of LibreLingo's repository . The course directory name is usually structured in <destination language>-from-<target audience's language> . e.g. french-from-english teaches French to English speakers. In each course you'll find modules. And in each module you'll find skills, which are saved as individual .yaml files. Now let's look into how they look on the frontend, to the user. Go to LibreLingo web app . Courses are listed there. e.g. You see a \"START LEARNING SWAHILI\" button. ( NOTE: Depending on the state and completeness of the courses, all of them might not be shown there on the website.) When you enter a course page, for example the Spanish course , you'll see headings like Basics, Introduction, Activities. These are modules. Each module contains a set of skills. Modules organize skills into groups, which is their only purpose. Think of them as groups of units or chapters. \"Skills\" are units of course content focused on a particular topic. Each skill is a set of new knowledge, such as new words or phrases. Skills can focus on vocabulary and follow a theme: the \"Animal\" skill has words and phrases related to animals, the \"Food\" skill is all about food. Skills can also focus on teaching grammar. Inside a skill YAML file there are some keys that you might want to learn of, which is exaplained in detail here . Things you can do as a new contributor If you are new in contributing to course data, these are the things you can do to get a proper understanding of the courses and have a good time with the project: Go to LibreLingo's Spanish course and try out some of the skills. Just get an idea on how the questions are structured and the type of answers made available. Browse this repository or download it and study the courses directory and how everything's laid out. Be sure to have a good text editor, such as Notepad++ , Geany in hand to view or edit files. Try to learn how data is organized within .yaml files and directories. Course , Module and Skill documentation may help you on this. Try to learn how YAML works. (see here or here or here ) Determine some information about the language you're working with. Your language name in English. e.g. French, Ancient Greek Language slug (lowercase and no spaces). e.g. french, ancient-greek IETF BCP 47 tag name for your language, which you can get from here .

Ask people on GitHub Discussions. Table of Contents: - Setup - Pulling code and branching - Pushing code and creating Pull Request - Following up with responses - Translating based on an existing course - Editing existing courses Setup Pulling code and branching LibreLingo uses Git repository for maintaining code. In order to contribute changes, you need to first fork this project. To fork: - login to GitHub - then go to LibreLingo repository - click the \"Fork\" button (beside Watch and Star) In a moment you will be taken to a new repository. Closely notice the url as it will be https://github.com/<your github username>/LibreLingo/ instead of https://github.com/kantord/LibreLingo/ . Now you should have a copy of the project source code under your name. This is called \" forking \". Forking allows you to apply your changes without directly changing the original project. Now click the Green \"Code\" button and copy the HTTPS clone URL. Make sure you have Git installed on your computer. If not, follow these instructions to install it on your operating system. If you are not used to command line programs, there are also graphical interface applications for Git, like Git Cola , TortoiseGit etc. They can basically do the same thing but graphically. But we'll focus on the command line here. If you want to use them, consult their documentation to get your way around them. To clone the repository you forked into earlier: git clone <URL you copied> cd LibreLingo The first command will download the forked repository on your computer so that you can make edits. Second one will go inside the repository directory for future git commands to work. In order to add your name and email to the changes you do later, git would need to know them before you apply any changes to the code. You can add these by running: git config --global user.name \"John Doe\" git config --global user.email \"john@example.com\" NOTE: Replace the name and email above to match yours. Setting --global sets these values globally for any repo on the machine. You can run it without the --global parameter to set it for this repo only. Now create a new branch for your changes: git checkout -b my-awesome-branch main This is creating a new branch named my-awesome-branch from main branch and switches to the new branch. The branch name doesn't matter that much. You just need to be able to recognize it yourself from a list of other branches. You can just name it as your language name if you want, but without spaces (e.g. korean , ancient-greek ). You can check which branch you are on by running git status and checking the \"On branch\" line. You are now ready to make changes. Pushing code and creating Pull Request These instructions are written to be used after making the changes. So you can read the rest of the page and continue from here if you want. After you made your changes, add the files and commit your changes: git add courses/ git commit -m \"Add Example language\" NOTE: Replace the commit message to describe what it does in your case. Another thing is that make your changes only on one commit because it will be easier to maintain and apply possible changes into later. If you want to add something else to the commit, just use the --amend command below. This hasn't yet been sent to the repo online. The changes are only on your machine. If you feel like you've missed something, there is a chance you can make the changes and run: git add courses/ git commit --amend --no-edit This will add (amend) the new changes to the last commit that you did earlier. To see what changes are included in your last commit, run git show -1 and use Page up and Page down key to scroll through it all or q to quit. When you are ready to push the changes: git push origin HEAD # or git push origin my-awesome-branch You may be asked to enter your GitHub username and password. NOTE: It's recommended that you create an access token and use it instead of the password due to security reasons. Due to a change in GitHub's policy, using passwords will not work from August 13, 2021 and may not work on certain times during June and July. Now go to your fork of the project (e.g. https://github.com/<your github username>/LibreLingo/ ). You'll see a message above the file list saying something like \"my-awesome-branch had recent pushes less than a minute ago\" offering you to \"Compare & pull request\" with a button. Click the button and explain what your changes are about and post a pull request. A pull request is a request to apply your changes to the original project. Such a request is not immediately applied, rather goes through a review process. After you posted the pull request, project maintainers will look into your changes and respond. When they do, you'll get a notification on GitHub. Following up with PR responses Depending on the Pull Request (PR) you made earlier, you can either get accepted right away (in that case it will be \"merged\") or you may need to make some changes (you'll get comments). If the project maintainers ask for a change, do this: cd into the git repository directory, or open a terminal on the directory Make sure you're on the branch in which you made changes earlier. Check with git status and if not on proper branch, switch to it with: git checkout my-awesome-branch NOTE: If you don't remember which branch you were in, check the Pull request you made or run git branch -a to find out and switch to it. Make the changes requested. Check that the changes are what you were asked to do by running git diff (Page up/down to scroll, q to quit). When ready: git add courses/ git commit --amend --no-edit git push origin HEAD -f The -f switch is to force push so that the existing commit gets updated. NOTE: The git commit --amend command amends (or updates) the changes into the last commit you made. So it is important that you keep your changes in a branch on a single commit (if you followed the instructions above you should be fine). Translating based on an existing course If you just want to translate an existing course, the simplest way is to copy an existing course. Right now spanish-from-english is the most complete. So: Go to courses directory on the repository you cloned earlier. Make sure you also do the git checkout command to create a new branch. Copy spanish-from-english and rename the copy as yourlanguageslug-from-english (replace yourlanguageslug to your language slug ) Edit yourlanguageslug-from-english/course.yaml to change keys under Language ( details here ) Now keep editing Spanish parts to translate into your language with a text editor If you need more details, consult Course , Module or Skill documentation NOTE: When editing existing skill yaml files, do not change the skill IDs since you are just editing existing courses. If you change skill IDs it may create issues. New skill IDs are only needed in case if you create new skills . When you are done, you can continue to the pull request section to submit the changes. Editing existing courses If you want to make edits to course data, consult Course , Module or Skill documentation for details or discuss if you're unsure on how to do something.","title":"Editing LibreLingo courses"},{"location":"courses/editing-courses.html#editing-librelingo-courses","text":"Thank you for your interest in contributing to LibreLingo.

After you made your changes, add the files and commit your changes: git add courses/ git commit -m \"Add Example language\" NOTE: Replace the commit message to describe what it does in your case. Another thing is that make your changes only on one commit because it will be easier to maintain and apply possible changes into later. If you want to add something else to the commit, just use the --amend command below. This hasn't yet been sent to the repo online. The changes are only on your machine. If you feel like you've missed something, there is a chance you can make the changes and run: git add courses/ git commit --amend --no-edit This will add (amend) the new changes to the last commit that you did earlier. To see what changes are included in your last commit, run git show -1 and use Page up and Page down key to scroll through it all or q to quit. When you are ready to push the changes: git push origin HEAD # or git push origin my-awesome-branch You may be asked to enter your GitHub username and password. NOTE: It's recommended that you create an access token and use it instead of the password due to security reasons. Due to a change in GitHub's policy, using passwords will not work from August 13, 2021 and may not work on certain times during June and July. Now go to your fork of the project (e.g. https://github.com/<your github username>/LibreLingo/ ). You'll see a message above the file list saying something like \"my-awesome-branch had recent pushes less than a minute ago\" offering you to \"Compare & pull request\" with a button. Click the button and explain what your changes are about and post a pull request. A pull request is a request to apply your changes to the original project. Such a request is not immediately applied, rather goes through a review process. After you posted the pull request, project maintainers will look into your changes and respond. When they do, you'll get a notification on GitHub.","title":"Pushing code and creating Pull Request"},{"location":"courses/editing-courses.html#following-up-with-pr-responses","text":"Depending on the Pull Request (PR) you made earlier, you can either get accepted right away (in that case it will be \"merged\") or you may need to make some changes (you'll get comments). If the project maintainers ask for a change, do this: cd into the git repository directory, or open a terminal on the directory Make sure you're on the branch in which you made changes earlier. Check with git status and if not on proper branch, switch to it with: git checkout my-awesome-branch NOTE: If you don't remember which branch you were in, check the Pull request you made or run git branch -a to find out and switch to it. Make the changes requested. Check that the changes are what you were asked to do by running git diff (Page up/down to scroll, q to quit). When ready: git add courses/ git commit --amend --no-edit git push origin HEAD -f The -f switch is to force push so that the existing commit gets updated. NOTE: The git commit --amend command amends (or updates) the changes into the last commit you made. So it is important that you keep your changes in a branch on a single commit (if you followed the instructions above you should be fine).","title":"Following up with PR responses"},{"location":"courses/editing-courses.html#translating-based-on-an-existing-course","text":"If you just want to translate an existing course, the simplest way is to copy an existing course.

Such identifiers can be generated using this website . Before skills will actually show up in the web app, they need to be added to a module.yaml . Examples of editing a skill This is how you'd add a new alternative version to the phrase \"La femme dit bonjour\": Phrases: - Phrase: La femme dit bonjour Alternative versions: - La femme dit salut + - La madame dit salut Translation: The woman says hello Alternative translations: - The woman says hi Keep in mind that when you add a new phrase, or a new version or translation to a phrase, it's not automatically updating to the mini-dictionary. So you need to add any new words there: Mini-dictionary: French: - dit: says + - madame: lady - bonjour: - hello - hi - L'homme: the man Also note, that the new words from each phrase listed under Phrases key need to be added for both the source and the target language in the Mini-dictionary . For example: Mini-dictionary: French: - dit: says - bonjour: - hello - hi ... English: - says: dit - hello: - bonjour - salut Don't worry about listing the same word more than once in a course. It will not cause any issues if you do so. Tips for creating good skills When it comes to teaching grammar, your main tool is to teach by example. Use words to teach nouns that can be demonstrated easily with pictures, such as \"dog\", \"car\", \"tree\", \"city\". Do not try to teach verbs, adjectives, etc. using words. Instead, use them in phrases.
